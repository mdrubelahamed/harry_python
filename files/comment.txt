Whispers of the wind, soft and low,  
Through the trees, where shadows grow.  
A moonlit path, a gentle stream,  
Life unfolds like a fleeting dream.  

Stars above, a cosmic dance,  
A fleeting moment, a fleeting chance.  
Time moves on, steady and true,  
Painting the world in every hue.  

Embrace the night, the calm, the still,  
Feel the earth, its gentle will.  
For in this world, both vast and small,  
We find our place, a part of it all.
