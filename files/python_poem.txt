In a forest of logic, where dreams are born,
Python weaves patterns from dusk until morn.
With simple sweet syntax, it hums like a stream,
Flowing through bytes in a technicolor dream.

Python, oh Python, a serpent of grace,
Twisting through puzzles in digital space.
Its laughter is 'print', its wisdom is 'def',
A whisper of code in each clever step.

From turtle's slow crawl to the quantum unknown,
Python builds bridges from stone upon stone.
In every soft 'import', a portal appears,
A journey through thought that conquers all fears.

Python, dear Python, your magic runs deep,
In the loops of my heart, your secrets I keep.
